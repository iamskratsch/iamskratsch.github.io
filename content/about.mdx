I am a very curious individual, with the unique ability of harnessing that curiosity and turning it into innovative and impactful actions. I have a track record of being an innovative and adaptive team member with a unquenchable passion for technology and solving problems while challenging the status quo. &quot;This is the way we&apos;ve always done it&quot; doesn&apos;t cut it anymore.

For over 20 years, I have taken on progressively more responsibility with a broad range of technical and managerial experiences, and my diverse background allows me to bring unique and transparent perspectives, positively challenge the status quo, and help individuals and teams achieve more then they think possible.

It is not uncommon for me to be working on multiple high-priority projects simultaneously while prioritizing the workload and maintaining the integrity and quality of the work being done. I am also proficient at developing, innovating, and implementing new strategies for evolving and transforming the team and organization. Day to day duties include Cloud Architect and Engineering, Solution Architecture, Web Development, Program/Project Management, Solution Delivery, Strategy & Roadmapping, and Team Leadership.

Overall, I offer a wide range of skills and experience in people and technical management. Other core skills include:

* Adaptive Leadership Style
* Project / Program development and management
* Strategic planning and tactical implementation
* Drive and personal ambition to reach and surpass goals
