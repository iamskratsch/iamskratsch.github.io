# GitFlow Branching Strategy

## Introduction

GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It's a consistent way to manage and track features, releases, and hotfixes in your projects. This model uses multiple branches to manage the development process efficiently and ensure that you can release your software at any point.

## Setting Up GitFlow

To set up GitFlow in your project, you'll need to initialize your repository with two main branches: `master` and `develop`.

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create the 'develop' branch
git checkout -b develop

# Push the 'develop' branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin develop
```

The `master` branch stores the official release history, while the `develop` branch serves as an integration branch for features.

## Working with GitFlow

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

```bash
# Start a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature_branch

# Edit some files
git commit -a -m "Start a feature"

# Edit some files
git commit -a -m "Finish a feature"

# Merge back into develop when done
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature_branch
```

### Release Branches

Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). By doing all of this work on a release branch, the `develop` branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.

```bash
# Start a release branch
git checkout -b release/0.1.0 develop

# Edit some files
git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 0.1.0"

# Finish up the release branch
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/0.1.0
```

### Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned. They arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version.

```bash
# Start a hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix_branch master

# Edit some files
git commit -a -m "Fix something"

# Merge back into master when done
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix_branch

# Also merge back into develop so it has the fix too!
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix_branch
```

## Conclusion

The GitFlow branching strategy is an efficient way to manage and track changes in your projects. It allows you to isolate new features, prepare for releases, and fix bugs in your live application without disrupting the main development flow. By using this model, you can ensure that you're always ready to release your software at any time.
